# Current Progress

## Latest Verified Status

- **Unified workspace（2026-05-17 晚）**：`D:\openclaw-tools\ion-dex-nuke` 根目录 `scripts\verify-full.cmd` / `verify-full-save-log.cmd` 已通过：编码扫描 **435** 文件 OK；前端 `npm run verify`（`build` + `start-server-and-test` 监听 **TCP `127.0.0.1:59333`** 后跑 Playwright，避免本机环境下误把 HTTP **400** 当成「预览已就绪」）**Playwright 12 passed**（含 Trade/Grid/Pool/Stake/**Bridge/Burn/Domain/AI** 草稿表单校验）；`audit:high` **0**。**AppShell** 顶栏改为 `flex + overflow-x-auto`：当前 Tailwind 生产产物未生成可用的 `lg:` 断点时，`hidden lg:flex` 会令导航整块 `display:none`，E2E 无法点到 `nav-*`。
- Pool / Stake milestone（先前 empty-window 基线）：编码、`npm run verify`、`audit:high` 均已绿灯。
- If `frontend/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` picks up NUL bytes after an edit, run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check-encoding.ps1 -Path .\frontend\e2e -Fix` from repo root.

- Desktop Commander MCP is installed and loaded as `user-desktop-commander`.
- Real command execution is confirmed:
  - `DC_OK`
  - `node v22.22.0`
  - `npm 11.3.0`
- Frontend build passes through Desktop Commander:

- Encoding check passes after auto-fixing corrupted files:

```text
Scanned: 31 files
OK - All files are UTF-8 without BOM, no NUL bytes.
```

- Configured Memory Bank MCP globally and at project level:
  - server name: `ion-dex-memory-bank`
  - root: `.memory-bank/`
- Six-pillar verification baseline:
  - `docs/verification-six-pillars.md`
  - `docs/07-verification-README.md`
- Playwright smoke E2E: `frontend/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`, `frontend/playwright.config.ts`
- Frontend scripts: `preview:local`, `test:e2e`, `verify`, `audit:high`
- Root script: `scripts/verify-full.ps1` (encoding + frontend verify + audit)
- `frontend/.gitignore` for Playwright output dirs
- Stable UI hooks: `data-testid` on brand, main, ticker, swap submit
- Added state-driven frontend page routing without adding a routing dependency.
- Added business page shells for `Trade`, `Grid`, `Pool`, `Stake`, `Bridge`, `Burn`, `Domain`, and `AI`.
- Extended Playwright smoke coverage to verify top navigation opens each business page shell.
- Agent-side verification loop is now usable via command output written to `%TEMP%` and read back by the agent.
- Added the 100-pass full green verification rule for continuing feature development.
- Added project-specific Cursor Skills:
  - `ion-official-source`
  - `ion-web3-ui`
  - `ion-contract-audit`
  - `ion-data-backend`
  - `cursor-engineering-workflow`
  - `ion-dev-accelerators`
- Added Cursor Agent Review rules:
  - `BUGBOT.md`
- Completed the 100-pass full green verification gate:
  - `PASSED=100`
  - `FAILED=0`
  - `RESULT=GREEN`
- Indexed Cursor official documentation into local project memory:
  - `docs/cursor-docs-feature-memory.md`
  - Source: `https://cursor.com/cn/docs`
  - Sitemap: `https://cursor.com/llms.txt`
- Indexed development accelerators into local project memory:
  - `docs/development-accelerators-memory.md`
  - Includes Git worktrees, Cursor `/worktree`, `/best-of-n`, Hooks, Agent Review, Bugbot, Cloud Agents, Cursor CLI/GitHub Actions, CI permission patterns, MCP, Rules, and Skills.
- Completed the interactive `Trade` and `Grid` frontend milestone:
  - `Trade` now has side/order controls, amount, price, slippage validation, preview, disabled submit state, and wallet-signing draft confirmation.
  - `Grid` now has mode, price bounds, grid count, investment validation, preview, disabled submit state, and AI Sentinel gated draft confirmation.
  - Playwright smoke coverage now includes Trade limit-order drafting and Grid bound validation/strategy drafting.
  - `frontend/playwright.config.ts` wraps the preview command with `cmd.exe /d /c` for stable Windows webServer startup.
- Latest Trade/Grid verification:
  - Encoding: `ENCODING_EXIT=0`
  - Frontend verify: `VERIFY_EXIT=0`
  - Audit high: `AUDIT_EXIT=0`
  - Playwright: `6 passed`
- Trade/Grid 100-pass verification gate completed on 2026-05-17:
  - `PASS 100/100`
  - `RESULT=GREEN`
  - exit code `0`
- Completed interactive `Pool` and `Stake` frontend milestone:
  - Pool liquidity panel with slippage validation, preview, and liquidity mint draft confirmation.
  - Stake hub with stake/unstake modes, validation, APR preview line, and per-mode draft confirmations.
  - Playwright smoke extended for pool and stake flows; submit-button assertions use `stake-submit` test id to avoid strict-mode ambiguity.

## Known Issues

- Memory Bank MCP config is written but tools are not yet verified. Cursor needs MCP reload/restart.
- UI has initial dashboard plus business page shells. `Trade`, `Grid`, `Pool`, and `Stake` now have interactive validated draft flows; `Bridge`, `Burn`, `Domain`, and `AI` remain shell-level.
- After pulling changes, run locally: `cd frontend && npm install && npx playwright install chromium && npm run verify` (agent shell may not update `package-lock.json` in this environment).
- Visual regression / pixel-diff vs design mockups not yet set up.
- Smart contracts and backend services are not yet implemented.
- ION official codebase path confirmed: `D:/openclaw-tools/ion`.
- Confirmed remote: `https://github.com/ice-blockchain/ion`.
- Memory Bank file `official-source-index.md` now records official reusable areas and DEX caveat.
- Runtime frontend connection issue resolved for current session: Vite dev server started on `http://127.0.0.1:3001/`, and both `http://127.0.0.1:3001/` and `http://localhost:3001/` returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.
- Added frontend script `npm run dev:local` to start Vite directly on `127.0.0.1:3001` without fragile CLI argument forwarding.
- Next feature development can proceed from the completed 100-run verification baseline.
- Domain-specific future work must load the matching project skill before planning or editing.
- Meaningful diffs should run Cursor Agent Review (`/agent-review`) using `BUGBOT.md` before final verification.
- Cursor workflow/tooling questions should first consult `docs/cursor-docs-feature-memory.md`.
- The `cursor-engineering-workflow` skill should be loaded proactively for every development, verification, review, debugging, workflow, or tooling task.
- The `ion-dev-accelerators` skill should be loaded proactively for every development task to consider faster or safer workflows such as worktrees, best-of-n, hooks, CI automation, Cloud Agents, MCP, Rules, or Skills.
- The user should not need to request these accelerators explicitly; selecting and applying them is now part of the agent's development responsibility.

## Next Step

1. One-shot verification:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\admin\.cursor\projects\empty-window\ion-dex-nuke\frontend
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
cd ..
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\verify-full.ps1
```

2. For local interactive dev: `cd frontend && npm run dev:local` then open `http://localhost:3001/`.
3. Next milestone: add interactive `Bridge`, `Burn`, `Domain`, or `AI` flows (validation + Playwright), or move to contracts/backend per roadmap.
4. Official ION reference: `D:/openclaw-tools/ion`.
5. After meaningful diffs, run Cursor Agent Review (`/agent-review`) and then the verification baseline.
